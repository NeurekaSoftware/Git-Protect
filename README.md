## Quick Start

### Docker Compose

Download the compose file and the environment template (saved as `.env`):

```sh
curl -fsSLO https://raw.githubusercontent.com/neurekadev/git-backup/main/compose.yaml
curl -fsSL -o .env https://raw.githubusercontent.com/neurekadev/git-backup/main/.env.example
```

Create your settings file at `config/settings.yaml` next to `compose.yaml` (see [settings.yaml](#settingsyaml)),
then start the stack:

```sh
docker compose up -d
```

### Deployment notes

The image is a standalone static binary on a minimal base — no shell, no entrypoint script. The
container runs directly as the `user:` from `compose.yaml` (PUID/PGID from `.env`), and the process
receives SIGTERM as PID 1, so `docker compose stop` drains in-flight work cleanly.

> [!NOTE]
> The data volume is seeded with uid/gid 1000 ownership on first mount. If you change `PUID`/`PGID`
> later, run a one-time `docker compose run --rm -u 0 --entrypoint sh -c "chown -R PUID:PGID /app/data"`-style
> fixup or adjust the volume ownership yourself.

### settings.yaml

Place `settings.yaml` inside a `config/` directory next to `compose.yaml` (so the file is at
`config/settings.yaml`); `compose` binds that directory read-only into the container. The directory is
mounted rather than the file itself: a single-file bind mount pins the container to the original inode,
so edits saved by the write-and-rename that most editors use would never reach the container.

> [!TIP]
> These settings support hot reload, so you don't have to restart your container after editing
> `config/settings.yaml`. The change is picked up within a couple of seconds and logged.

Each entry under `repositories` accepts the options below. **Common** options apply to both modes; the rest belong to `mode: provider` or `mode: url`.

**Common**

| Option | Description | Default |
|---|---|---|
| `mode` | `provider` (discover all repositories for an account) or `url` (specific repositories). | *required* |
| `credential` | Credential key (from `credentials`) used to authenticate. Optional for public repositories in url mode. | *required in provider mode* |
| `lfs` | Back up Git LFS objects. | `true` |
| `cache` | Keep a local mirror and `git fetch` it each run for fast subsequent syncs. Set `false` to clone fresh each run and delete the local copy after a successful upload, bounding local disk to one repository at a time. | `true` |
| `enabled` | Set `false` to skip the job. | `true` |

**Provider mode** — `mode: provider`

| Option | Description | Default |
|---|---|---|
| `provider` | Forge to discover: `github`, `gitlab`, or `forgejo`. | *required* |
| `baseUrl` | Base URL of a self-hosted forge instance. | forge's public URL |
| `includeStarred` | Also back up repositories the account has starred. | `false` |
| `includeSnippets` | Also back up your GitHub gists and GitLab snippets. GitHub also backs up starred gists when `includeStarred` is on; GitLab has no starred snippets. | `false` |
| `includeIssues` | Back up issues and their comment threads as JSON. | `false` |
| `includeIssueArtifacts` | Also download files attached to issues and their comments. Requires `includeIssues`. | `false` |
| `includeMergeRequests` | Back up pull/merge requests and their comment threads as JSON. | `false` |
| `includeMergeRequestsArtifacts` | Also download files attached to pull/merge requests and their comments. Requires `includeMergeRequests`. | `false` |
| `includeReleases` | Back up releases (tag, notes, and asset references) as JSON. | `false` |
| `includeReleaseArtifacts` | Also download release asset files. Requires `includeReleases`. | `false` |

> [!NOTE]
> On GitLab, `includeReleaseArtifacts` downloads only asset-link files hosted on your own instance. Auto-generated source archives are skipped (the repository mirror already captures them), and external links are recorded as references without being downloaded.

**URL mode** — `mode: url`

| Option | Description | Default |
|---|---|---|
| `url` | A single repository URL, or a list of repository URLs. | *required* |

Local mirrors for repositories that are removed from the config (or disabled) are cleaned off disk automatically on the next run.

The optional `concurrency` section tunes parallelism and defaults to fully sequential:

| Option | Description | Default |
|---|---|---|
| `concurrency.repositories` | How many repositories a run clones, archives, and uploads in parallel. | `1` |
| `concurrency.metadata` | How many issues/merge requests are fetched (with comments) and uploaded in parallel within one repository. | `1` |

> [!TIP]
> Raising these overlaps network-bound work, but increases concurrent memory, local disk, and provider/S3 request pressure — raise gradually and watch for rate limiting (HTTP 429). With `cache: false`, running repositories in parallel multiplies peak local disk by the degree.

The optional `health` section exposes a small HTTP status endpoint so a stalled scheduler is visible from the outside:

| Option | Description | Default |
|---|---|---|
| `health.port` | Port the status listener binds to; `0` disables it. | `8080` |
| `health.bind` | Interface to listen on. Use `0.0.0.0` inside a container so the port can be published. | `localhost` |

`GET /` and `GET /healthz` return JSON describing the daemon; `status` reads `"ok"` until a run fails and `"degraded"` afterwards, so an Uptime-Kuma-style keyword check can alert on it:

```json
{"status":"ok","startedAt":"2026-09-09T20:29:39Z","lastRunStartedAt":null,"lastRunCompletedAt":null,"lastRunDurationSeconds":null,"lastRunOutcome":null,"nextRunAt":"2027-01-01T08:00:00Z"}
```

To publish it, add a mapping to `compose.yaml` and set the bind address:

```yaml
services:
  git-backup:
    ports:
      - "8080:8080"
```

```yaml
health:
  port: 8080
  bind: 0.0.0.0
```

### Credentials

Each key under `credentials` is a forge token, referenced by a repository job's `credential`. Every operation this tool performs is read-only, so create each token with the least privilege the features you enable require.

**GitHub** — create a **classic** personal access token; fine-grained tokens cannot read gists.

| Scope | Needed for |
|---|---|
| `repo` | Private repositories, plus their issues, pull requests, comments, releases, and attachments |
| `gist` | Gists (`includeSnippets`) |

Backing up only public repositories? `public_repo` replaces `repo`. Not backing up gists? Omit `gist`.

**GitLab** — create a personal access token with:

| Scope | Needed for |
|---|---|
| `read_api` | Discovering repositories and reading issues, merge requests, releases, and snippets |
| `read_repository` | Cloning repository contents, including private repositories and LFS objects |

**Forgejo** — create an access token granting read access to:

| Scope | Needed for |
|---|---|
| `read:repository` | Repositories, starred repositories, pull requests, releases, and attachments |
| `read:issue` | Issues and issue / pull-request comment threads |

### Keeping secrets out of settings.yaml

`storage.accessKeyId`, `storage.secretAccessKey`, and each `credentials.*.apiKey` accept a literal value, a `${ENV_VAR}` placeholder, or a companion `*File` key naming a file to read. Anyone who can read `settings.yaml` can otherwise recover every forge token and your storage keys at once, so prefer one of the indirections outside local testing.

```yaml
storage:
  # Read from the container environment — pairs with the .env file compose already loads.
  accessKeyId: ${S3_ACCESS_KEY_ID}
  secretAccessKey: ${S3_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY}

credentials:
  gitlab:
    username: git
    # Or read from a file, such as a Docker/Kubernetes secret mount.
    apiKeyFile: /run/secrets/gitlab_token
```

A referenced variable that is not set, a file that cannot be read, or a field given both ways is rejected at load rather than started up without.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Issues, pull/merge requests, releases, and their attachments are backed up for **owned** repositories only. They are never fetched for **starred** repositories — even when `includeStarred` is enabled — nor for gists or snippets.

Issues, pull/merge requests, and releases are stored as latest-state JSON documents (issues and MRs each embed their comment thread) next to the repository's Git snapshots. Each run overwrites these in place and removes documents for items that no longer exist upstream.

| Item | Stored at |
|---|---|
| Issues | `issues/{number}.json` |
| Pull / merge requests | `merge-requests/{number}.json` |
| Releases | `releases/{tag}.json` |
| Per-collection manifest | `{collection}/index.json` |
| Downloaded attachments | `{collection}/attachments/{id}/` |
